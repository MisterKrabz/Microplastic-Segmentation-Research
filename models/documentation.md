# Here is what each version represents 

## v0.1.x: used yolo s bounding box model - was not enough at detecting clusters 

## v0.2.x: used yolo x bounding box model - better at detecting clusters but has trouble with duplicate boxes and overconfidence 

## v0.3.x: used yolo l segmentation model - currently I am trying to see if segmentation will improve the clustering performance while also reducing the model's size to prevent duplicate boxes and overconfidence
